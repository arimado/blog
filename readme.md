#blog express

This is a blog to learn stuff about:
- querying and writing to a mongo database
- routes and middleware
- creating a REST API
- user authentication
- single-page applications
- Promises

Current Stack: Node, Express, Mongo, Handlebars

## Not sure about
- How different middleware callback functions work on the route.
- Promises (seems like method chaining with success/failure control flow?) Also, do they work in ES5?


## To do's
- Add post validation
- Fix admin routes in the routes/admin.js
